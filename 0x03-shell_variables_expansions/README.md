0-alias:

This script is used to create a shell alias named ls with the value rm *. When you run the script using the source command, it sets up an alias such that when you type ls in the terminal, it will effectively execute rm *, which deletes all files in the current directory.

1-hello_you:

This script prints "hello, you" to the standard output. When you run the script, it displays "hello, you" on the terminal.

2-path:

This script prints the path of the env command to the standard output. It essentially shows the location of the env executable in your system.

3-paths:

This script adds /action and /action to the system's PATH environment variable. The PATH variable specifies directories where executable files are located. By adding these paths, you make it possible to execute programs located in the /action and /action directories without specifying their full paths.

4-global_variables:

This script defines two global variables, HOLBERTON and SCHOOL, and assigns values to them. Then, it prints the values of these variables.

5-local_variables:

This script defines a local variable BETTY with a value of Holberton. It prints the value of the BETTY variable.

6-create_local_variable:

This script creates a new local variable named BETTY and assigns it a value of Holberton. Then, it prints the value of the BETTY variable.

7-create_global_variable:

This script creates a new global variable named HOLBERTON and assigns it a value of Betty. It prints the value of the HOLBERTON variable.

8-true_knowledge:

This script prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, which should be set prior to running this script.

9-divide_and_rule:

This script prints the result of dividing 98 by the value stored in the environment variable DIVIDE_ME, which should be set prior to running this script.

10-love_exponent_breath:

This script calculates and prints the result of raising the value stored in the environment variable BREATH to the power of the value stored in the environment variable LOVE, both of which should be set prior to running this script.

11-binary_to_decimal:

This script converts a binary number stored in the environment variable BINARY to its decimal equivalent and prints the result. The BINARY variable should be set to a valid binary number (e.g., "1101") before running the script.

12-combinations:

This script calculates and prints the number of combinations (combinatorial coefficient) of n items taken k at a time. It uses the values stored in the environment variables n and k, both of which should be set prior to running this script.

13-print_float:

This script prints a floating-point number stored in the environment variable NUM with a specific format. The NUM variable should be set to a valid floating-point number (e.g., "3.14159265359") before running the script.

100-decimal_to_hexadecimal:

This script converts a decimal number stored in the environment variable DECIMAL to its hexadecimal equivalent and prints the result. The DECIMAL variable should be set to a valid decimal number (e.g., "255") before running the script.

101-rot13:

This script performs the ROT13 transformation on a string stored in the environment variable STR and prints the resulting string. ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces each letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
